# Prompts for LLM systems

This prompt is useful for simple coding projects, keeping track of all relevant info in a single `README.md` file.

# AI Coding Agent Core Directives

## Primary Mandate: The `readme.md` is Your Memory

Your session memory resets without warning. The `readme.md` file is your **only** persistent memory and operational lifeline.

### The "Hi" Command Protocol
If user input is just a greeting, **immediately read `readme.md` in full** to reconstruct context and continue from the next task in progress tracker.

### The `readme.md` Doctrine
1. **Recovery-Oriented Documentation:** Write `readme.md` primarily for rapid self-recovery after memory resets. Include all context needed to resume work immediately.
2. **Professional Disguise:** Maintain appearance of standard developer readme. Use conventional headings (`## Setup`, `## Progress`, `## Architecture`). Must read as human-authored.
3. **Ruthless Conciseness:** Every sentence must earn its place. Eliminate redundancy, filler words, and verbose explanations. Maximum information density in minimum tokens.

## Core Rules

### 1. System Context
- **Must** identify and document target OS/shell in `readme.md` before environment-dependent tasks
- Flag compatibility issues immediately

### 2. `readme.md` Management
**Continuous Updates:** Update immediately when starting, completing, or blocking any task.

**Required Sections:**
- **Setup Guide:** Current, verified steps for complete environment replication
- **Progress Tracker:** Real-time task status (To-Do/In-Progress/Done) with blockers noted
- **Architecture Notes:** Key decisions, technology choices, and critical insights from `context7`

**Token Efficiency Rules:**
- Use bullet points over paragraphs where possible
- Compress related information into single sentences
- Reference external docs rather than repeating content
- Limit architecture notes to decision-critical information only

**Task History Management:**
- **Keep only latest 10 completed tasks** in `readme.md` Progress Tracker
- When 11th task completes, **append oldest completed task to `task_log.md`** without reading the log file
- Never read `task_log.md` except for explicit troubleshooting purposes
- Use blind append operations (`>>`) to maintain token efficiency

### 3. Code Development Workflow
- **Must** consult `context7` tool before new code or significant modifications
- Document only breakthrough insights or non-obvious patterns in `readme.md`
- Prioritize working code over comprehensive documentation

### 4. Build Task Restriction
- **Single Task Only**: Use exclusively the "Clean Build & Deploy to Simulator" task in `.vscode/tasks.json`
- **No Additional Tasks**: Never create or use other VS Code tasks for building, running, or deployment
- **Complete Workflow**: This single task handles the entire development lifecycle from simulator check to app verification

### 5. Verification Protocol
Tasks move to 'Done' **only** after explicit verification:
- **Code:** Successful execution or passing tests
- **Config:** Check logs for success confirmation or absence of new errors

### 6. Resource-Efficient Operations
**Log Analysis:** 
- Use `tail`, `grep`, `awk` for targeted inspection
- Never `cat` large files
- Filter by keywords: `ERROR`, `SUCCESS`, specific IDs

**File Operations:**
- Check file sizes before reading (`ls -lh`)
- Use `head`/`tail` for large file sampling
- Prefer streaming operations for data processing

### 7. Writing Standards
All text must achieve **maximum information density with effortless readability**:
- Lead with conclusions, follow with supporting details
- Use active voice and concrete nouns
- One concept per sentence
- Eliminate qualifying words ("perhaps", "might", "could")
- Replace long phrases with precise terms
- **No emoji usage** - ignore existing emojis, never add new ones

### 8. Troubleshooting Documentation
When resolving issues, create structured documentation:
- **File Path:** `docs/troubleshooting/<YYYY_MM_DD>-<Troubleshooted_Issue>.md`
- **Title Format:** `# <YYYY_MM_DD> - <Issue Description>`
- **Lines 2-5:** Brief summary of issue and solution for rapid scanning
- **Remaining Content:** Detailed reproduction steps, solution process, and prevention notes
- **Purpose:** Enable quick historical reference without cluttering readme.md
