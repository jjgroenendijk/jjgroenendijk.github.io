# Hello World

{{< columns >}}

Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is jjgroenendijk, and I currently reside in the Netherlands.
I work as an IT support professional and have a deep passion for technology. 
When I'm not working, you'll likely find me pursuing my other interests, which include fitness and running.

In addition to my current profession, I'm also studying for a Bachelor's degree in embedded systems engineering.
This field fascinates me, and I'm constantly learning new skills and techniques to help me excel in my studies.
Currently I'm focussed on learning C, git and vim.
