# Hello World

{{< columns >}}

Hi! My name is jjgroenendijk, and I currently reside in the Netherlands.
I work as an IT support professional and I study for a Bachelor's in Embedded System Engineering. 
When I'm not working, you'll likely find me pursuing my other interests, which include fitness and running.

I made this website to get some experience with Hugo and Git. I also use this website to take some notes of information
I might forget later. So mostly PowerShell snippets and Arch Linux configs will end up here. As I'm learning C and C++,
I'll probably write down some programming notes or IDE setup configs.
